Hey there! This is my **ImageConverter** tool I built to help myself (and now you!) convert images between different formats. I was tired of using online converters with ads and size limits, so I made this simple command-line tool that supports JPG, PNG, WebP, BMP, TIFF, and GIF formats.

## ‚ú® What It Does

I built this tool to:
- Convert images between different formats (obviously!)
- Process entire folders of images in one go
- Search through subfolders if needed
- Resize images while converting
- Adjust quality settings for JPG and WebP
- Convert images to grayscale when I need that vintage look

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
# Clone my repo
git clone https://github.com/ati2025/imageconverter.git
cd imageconverter

# Set up a virtual environment (I recommend this)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install the stuff you need
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üíª How To Use It

### Basic Conversion

This is the simplest way to convert a single image:

```bash
python image_converter.py -i input.jpg -o output.png
```

### Converting a Whole Folder

Got a bunch of images? No problem:

```bash
python image_converter.py -d input_folder -o output_folder -t png
```

### Including Subfolders

If your images are organized in subfolders:

```bash
python image_converter.py -d input_folder -o output_folder -t webp -r
```

### Resizing Images

Need to make images smaller or larger?

```bash
python image_converter.py -i input.jpg -o output.jpg -w 800 -h 600
```

### Adjusting Quality

For JPG or WebP, you can control the compression:

```bash
python image_converter.py -i input.jpg -o output.webp -q 85
```
